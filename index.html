 <h1>Exploring Data</h1>
    
<p>
In chapter 6 Cairo discusses exploratory data analysis. The goal of this kind of data analysis is to be able to find patterns in the data as well as any deviations in the data. Cairo talks about this idea of the norm, you can find the norm by calculating either the mean, median, or mode for a data set. Depending what you are looking at it may be more approriate to use the median instead of the mode. This is because median is not sensitive to extreme values like the mean. The norm is represented by some kind of pattern in the data. Once you have indentified the norm you are able to identify what Cairo refers to as exceptions. Exceptions are anything that deviates from the patterns or norm in the data. Exceptions can include values that are far from the mean. It is important to note that you will not be able to see the norms and exceptions in every chart. There are many ways to visualize data and each way can reveal different insights into that data.
